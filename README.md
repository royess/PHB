### PKU Hole Backup
<div/>

Only for record.

This program started recording at 4:00 on December 11, 2021.

Within six hours after a tree hole is sent, it will be recorded once per hour.

You can use `Ctrl + K` or `Command + K` to search `keyword` in this repository.

However, limited by program design, the current recording is up to 10 replies under each tree hole.
